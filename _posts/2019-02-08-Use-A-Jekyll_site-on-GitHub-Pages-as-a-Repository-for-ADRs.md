## Context

[Recording the context and logic behind decisions is a very good idea](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Decision

We will record ADRs as 'posts' in a Jekyll site deployed using GitHub Enterprise pages.


## Consequences

- We will have an ongoing, visible record of significant decisions.
- Members of the team will have to learn to write and publish Jekyll posts if they want to record
ADRs.
